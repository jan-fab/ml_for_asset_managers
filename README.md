This project follows the book Machine Learning for Asset Managers by Marcos M. López de Prado, applying its concepts to real market data.

The code is organized into the following key areas, following the chapters of the book:

* Market Data API – A tool for downloading and processing market data.

* Denoising and Detoning – Techniques to filter out noise and extract meaningful signals.

* Distance Metrics – Methods to quantify relationships between assets.

* Optimal Clustering – Clustering techniques tailored for financial data.

* Financial Labels – Labeling methods for supervised learning.

* Feature Importance Analysis – Identifying the most relevant predictors.

* Portfolio Construction – Applying ML techniques to portfolio optimization.

All code and analysis are written by me.
